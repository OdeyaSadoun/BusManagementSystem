Egged's buses carry about a million passengers daily, using close to 4,000 buses that cover a distance of about one million kilometers a day on the company's service lines.&#xA;&#xA; Egged, by H.N.  Bialik&#xA;&#xA; Haim Nachman Bialik, the national poet, is the one who coined the name for the group, which over the years has become synonymous with bus in Israel.  The name was chosen because in the year of the company's establishment, it was composed of four transportation companies that operated in the Hebrew community at the time.&#xA; Bialik, who immigrated to Israel a decade before its establishment, fell in love with the old new language and dedicated his life to becoming an everyday language - from kindergarten to bus ...&#xA;&#xA; Vision and values&#xA;&#xA; Public transportation is an integral part of national infrastructure and its contribution to the realization of personal potential and invaluable economic and social development.&#xA;&#xA; Egged, whose history is intertwined with the history of Israel, is committed to providing the highest level of public transportation services to Israeli residents and visitors.

The security challenges and the bumpy roads led those young people to form groups that led to the establishment of the Egged Cooperative in 1933.&#xA;&#xA; In the first decade of the cooperative, Egged's drivers became active partners in the establishment of the state on the way and in the protection of the settlement, and together with their colleagues in the other groups, they expanded the cooperative by merging additional groups.&#xA;&#xA; With the establishment of the state, Egged continued to grow and intensify, until 1967, when all three transport cooperatives were united under the umbrella of Egged.&#xA;&#xA; In the 1990s, the Ministry of Transportation decided to increase competitiveness in the public transportation market, and as part of this, it issued some of Egged's lines for operating tenders.
